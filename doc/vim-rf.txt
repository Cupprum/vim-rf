Section 1: Dependecies                          *vim-rf-dependecies*

It is possible to use this pluggin without any external dependecies.
That being said, its functionality would be pretty incompetent.
On start of Vim, vim-rf tests for present external dependecies.
After that, vim-rf creates command bindings to only those commands,
which could be executed without any problem.
Here is a list of all external dependecies.

    - python -> https://www.python.org/downloads/
    - robot -> https://pypi.org/project/robotframework/
    - rflint -> https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-lint/

If you would like to list commmands that are currently available
for your use, look for command :RFDebug in |vim-rf-usage|.

====================================================================
Section 2: Usage                                      *vim-rf-usage*

This plugin will automatically provide syntax highlighting for
Robot Framework files (files ending in .robot).

It is also a filetype plugin, so it extends Vim with new super cool
functionality when working with Robot Framework.

The :RFTestCase command finds out name of current Test Case and
executes it.
Example:
>
    :RFTestCase
<
All you need to do is place your cursor on the name of the Test
Case or somewhere inside the scope of the Test Case and |vim-rf|
will take care of the rest. After Test Case execution, the output
will be printed in scratch buffer created as a new split.
It is possible not to execute Test Case, but just to print its name
by adding -l to the command like this:
>
    :RFTestCase -l
<
The :RFTestFile command executes all tests in current file. Output
of executed tests is then displayed in new scratch buffer, which is
created as a split.
Example:
>
    :RFTestFile
<
It is also possible to list all names of Test Cases before the
execution by specifying flag -l like this:
>
    :RFTestFile -l
<
In order for listing Test Cases
properly, it is necessary to have python installed in path. Also
this previously mentioned version of python must have robot
framework installed. It is highly advised to install robot
framework with pip.

Robot Framework allows its users to create Test Suites by
collecting similar Test Files in Folders or Directories. |vim-rf|
allows running all Test Cases from current Test Suite by:
>
    :RFTestDir
<
Output of executed Test Cases is then displayed in new scratch
buffer, which is created as a split.
It is also possible just to list names of Test Cases by:
>
    :RFTestDir -l
<
List of Test Case names will be displayed then in new scratch
buffer, which is created as a split.

If you have rflint (Robot Framework Lint) installed you can use
command :RFLint to print all Errors and Warnings in new scratch
buffer.
Example:
>
    :RFLint
<
Command :RFCommentLine works in normal and also visual mode and
is used to comment current line or highlighted block of lines.
Example normal mode:
>
    :RFCommentLine
<
Example visual mode:
>
    :'<,'>RFCommentLine
<
It is also possible to uncomment current lino or highlighted
block of lines by:
>
    :RFUncommentLine
<
or:
>
    :'<,'>RFUncommentLine
<
Command :RFDebug is used for listing all currently available
commands. It will open scratch buffer in new split which will
contain list of all available commands.
>
    :RFDebug
<

Section 3: Mappings                                *vim-rf-mappings*

This plugin does not intend to create mappings because it could
cause overwriting some of users predefined mappings. Because of
this reason only command were created. If you want to map these
commands, feel free to inspire from next mappings code example.
Just copy and paste them into your |.vimrc|. >

    " Map control slash to Comment Lines
    nnoremap <C-_> :RFCommentLine<CR>
    vnoremap <C-_> :RFCommentLine<CR>

    " Map control question mark to Uncomment Lines
    nnoremap <C-?> :RFUncommentLine<CR>
    vnoremap <C-?> :RFUncommentLine<CR>

    " Map <Leader> t to testing single Test Case
    nnoremap <leader>t :RFTestCase<CR>
    nnoremap <leader>T :RFTestCase -l<CR>

    " Map <Leader> f to testing all Test Cases in current file
    nnoremap <leader>f :RFTestFile<CR>
    nnoremap <leader>F :RFTestFile -l<CR>

    " Map <Leader> d to testing all Test Cases in current Test Suite
    nnoremap <leader>D :RFTestDir<CR>
    nnoremap <leader>D :RFTestDir -l<CR>

I know that first mapping says <C-_> and not <C-/> in order to
map the mapping to Control slash. This is beacuse of Vim's funny
way of working with slash character so trust me on this one.

Section 4: License                                  *vim-rf-license*

Same terms as Vim itself (see |license|)
